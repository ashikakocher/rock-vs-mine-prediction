# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify whether a sonar signal is reflected from a rock or a mine based on 60 features.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Format: 208 rows Ã— 60 columns (numeric features), last column is label: 'R' (Rock), 'M' (Mine)

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter/Colab

## How it works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Split into training and test sets
3. Train Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluate using accuracy score
5. Predict outcome for new input

## Result
Achieved over 80% accuracy in detecting rocks vs mines.
